## <a name="about"></a>About MindProbe
**MindProbe** provides a server to host online experiments. This server runs the open-source software [JATOS](https://www.jatos.org/), which is compatible with several free software packages for developing online experiments, including [OpenSesame/OSWeb](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), and [Lab.JS](https://lab.js.org/). MindProbe is affiliated with [ESCOP](https://www.escop.eu/), with [Journal of Cognition](https://www.journalofcognition.org/) as their official journal.

### Time frame

For now we plan to offer this server until the end of February 2022.

### Please talk to us ... 

... before you run your study with participants if:

- You want to run a study with many participants at the same time (e.g. send out a link by Twitter, Facebook etc.)
- You have high data volume ( >1 MB per component) in your result data or result files of your study
- You want to upload audio/video in your study

All these will increase the traffic, and therefore the server costs, so please just check with us that it’s within our budget.

### Privacy and ethics



- This JATOS server is hosted in the cloud (Digital Ocean), within the European Union and uses encryption for all network traffic. So you should check whether a cloud-hosted server complies to the ethics regulations of your institution.
- MindProbe and JATOS themselves do not store user information apart from what is necessary to create the user account (username, name).
- More can be found under [http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html](http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html)

### Backup your result data

Right now the MindProbe server is backed up only on a weekly basis. Please export your result data on a regular basis since otherwise in the (unlikely) case of a server failure your data might get lost. Sadly, we will probably not have the capacity to help you troubleshoot or recover lost data.

### Research only

No private use, no commercial use.
