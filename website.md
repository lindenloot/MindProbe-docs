**MindProbe** is a server to host online experiments. This server runs the open-source software [JATOS](https://www.jatos.org/), which is compatible with several free software packages for developing online experiments, including [OpenSesame/OSWeb](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), and [Lab.JS](https://lab.js.org/). MindProbe is sponsored by [ESCOP](https://www.escop.eu/), with [Journal of Cognition](https://www.journalofcognition.org/) as their official journal. MindProbe is free.

## <a name="terms-of-use"></a>Terms of use


### Time frame and availability

We will provide this server at least until the end of February 2022. Whether we will be able to continue after this period depends on the available funding.

As electronic services are subject to interruption or breakdown, access to the MindProbe server is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis only.

In the future, we may impose restrictions on the use of MindProbe. Furthermore, for security, technical, maintenance, legal or regulatory reasons, or due to any breach of these Terms of Use, we may withdraw this service at any time and without advance notice.


### Please talk to us if ...

- You want to run a study with many near-simultaneous participants (> 100). For example, if you plan to send out a link on Twitter or Facebook, or if you plan to recruit many participants through Prolific.
- You have high data volume ( >1 MB per component) in your result data or result files of your study
- Your experiment file is large (> 5 Mb). This mostly applies to experiments that include audio/video

All these factors increase traffic, and therefore server costs. So please just check with us that it’s within our budget. We will say yes to reasonable requests.


### Privacy and ethics

- This JATOS server is hosted in the cloud (Digital Ocean), within the European Union, and uses encryption for all network traffic. It is your own responsibility to check whether a cloud-hosted server complies with the privacy and ethics regulations of your institution.
- MindProbe and JATOS themselves do not store user information apart from what is necessary to create the user account (username, name).
- More can be found under [http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html](http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html)


### Backups

MindProbe is backed up only on a weekly basis. Therefore, export your result data on regularly, because in the (unlikely) case of a server failure you may lose up to a week of data. We do not have the capacity to help troubleshoot or recover lost data.


### Non-profit research only

No private use, no commercial use. Here, 'commercial use' includes research conducted by for-profit organizations (e.g. the R&D department of a company).


### Limitation of liability

We are not liable for what kind of data you, as a user, store from the participants’ of your experiments (e.g. result data, result files, session data or log messages). It is your own responsibility to ensure that the data you store on the MindProbe server complies with the respective privacy regulations of your location.

We are not liable to you for any losses, damages, claims and expenses whatsoever.

Abusive accounts will be suspended without advance notice. Here, 'abuse' includes (but is not limited to) spamming, distribution of illegal materials, and collection of illegal data.
