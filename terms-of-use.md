## Time frame and availability

We will provide this server at least until the end of February 2022. Whether we will be able to continue after this period depends on the available funding.

As electronic services are subject to interruption or breakdown, access to the MindProbe server is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis only.

In the future, we may impose restrictions on the use of MindProbe. Furthermore, for security, technical, maintenance, legal or regulatory reasons, or due to any breach of the terms of use, we may withdraw this service at any time and without advance notice.


## Non-profit research only

No private use, no commercial use. Here, 'commercial use' includes research conducted by for-profit organizations (e.g. the R&D department of a company).


## Limitation of liability

We are not liable for the data that you, the user (researcher), store from the participantsâ€™ of your experiments (e.g. result data, result files, session data or log messages). It is your own responsibility to ensure that the data you store on the MindProbe server complies with all relevant regulations, which includes (but may not be limited to) regulations of the European Union, regulations of The Netherlands, and regulations of the location where the user (researcher) is based.

We are not liable for any losses, damages, claims and expenses whatsoever that result from using MindProbe.


## Abusive and illegal content
